# Rank-To-Group (RTG) score evaluates contribution of confounders

<img src="example/confounder_contribution.png" />

Batch, cell line, donor, plate, reprogramming, protocol --- these and other confounding factors influence cell cultures in vitro.

RTG score tracks contribution of different factors to variability 
by estimating how Rank maps to Group. 
Scoring relies on ranking by similarity, so there is no explicit or implicit assumption of linearity.

RTG perfectly works with both well-interpretable data (gene expressions, cell types) 
and embeddings provided by deep-learning.
